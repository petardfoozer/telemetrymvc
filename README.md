# telemetrymvc
An open source PHP framework

This is a project mainly focused on helping me learn more about MVC frameworks. 

I will be updating when I feel the urge to write more functionality into the framework

Future plans are to add support for:

- File Encryption
- SFTP transfer
- Samba Share connection

To get started
 - edit /public/.htaccess file line 4 to set your rewrite base
 - edit /app/config/config
    - Define your DB_HOST
    - Define your DB_USER
    - Define your DB_PASS
    - Define your DB_NAME
    - Define your URL_ROUTE
    - Define your SITE_NAME
